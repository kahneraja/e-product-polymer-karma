e-product-polymer-karma
=======================
This is an working and maintainable approach for working with Mocha and Polymer.

Things bring together a number of attempts to resolving issues with the following files.
- linking specs with polymer elements.
- setting up the karma.conf file to references files suitably.
- ensuring the karma-mocha context is rendering efficiently.
- creating easy to read polymer unit tests.
- dealing with that pescky '/base' path api issue that continues to happy with karma and polymer.
